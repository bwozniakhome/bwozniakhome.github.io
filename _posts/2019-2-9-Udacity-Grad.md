title: Udacity Machine Learning Graduate
---

I have graduated from the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program! Hurray!

For those of you who are confused, let me explain. Udacity is an online educational program. 
This company offers "nanodegrees" or short (4-6 month) programs to help deepen knowledge on a given subject. 
Back in May 2018 I decided I wanted to change my career from being an actuary to being a data scientist. 
I loved building machine learning models and exploring data, usually through Kaggle. I thought it would be a good idea to get a boost in 
my machine learning skills so I entered into Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. I have spent the last several months 
working on guided machine learning projects in Python that ultimately culminated in me doing a Capstone Project, where I picked my own
data and my own machine learning models to build. I am very proud of the work I have accomplished, especially on my Capstone. I feel like
I have been pushed beyond my comfort zone, but with that has come mighty growth personally. I will be writing more about my Nanodegree in
future posts, but if you wish to take a look at my projects you can see my Jupyter notebooks on github [here](https://github.com/bwozniakhome/MLNano/tree/master/projects).
Not all of the projects were required so right now you will only see projects in the boston_housing, finding_donors, capstone, and customer_segments 
folders. In time I will also add my Convolutional Neural Network Images project and my Reinforcement Learning Project where I attempted to 
train a quadcopter to fly. 

This was a hard, but good, experience. I feel like I have enhanced my machine learning knowledge, my Python skills, and my 
communication skills.
