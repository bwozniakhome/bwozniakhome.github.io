title: Welcome to Brian's Blog&#58; A Perspective on Data Science
---

Hello! And welcome to my blog! I am excited to begin this part of my data science journey! 

This blog will be the home of projects, tutorials, book and paper reviews, thoughts, and just about anything else. 

To start things off, I would like to share some thoughts about the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, which I completed last month. It is a great program and I learned a lot. The program covers methods in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. My favorite part of the program was getting to apply the things I learned in the program to complete a Capstone Project. For my Capstone Project I analyzed data from Kaggle related to credit in banking. I used three models to predict how likely a borrower is to experience financial distress in the next two years. Those models were a Support Vector Machine, a Random Forest, and a Gradient Boosting Machine. Surprisingly, the Support Vector Machine did the best when measured using the area under the ROC curve. 

To learn more about my Capstone Project you can find the report [here](https://github.com/bwozniakhome/MLNano/blob/master/projects/capstone/Capstone_Proposal.pdf) and the code [here](https://github.com/bwozniakhome/MLNano/blob/master/projects/capstone/Capstone%20Project.ipynb).

Thanks for reading and enjoy!
